          <p> Hello! My name is Hannah Rashdan and I am a _______ major in the College of
            Human Ecology. I chose to join because I wanted to find a
            club that I could personally belong to on campus. As a person from Syria, I have
            a harder time finding people who I could relate to on a cultural and personal level.
            Then I found this club and it has had a great impact on my life.
